# Informal Notes on Expected Changes in OCTO-039 and OCTO-040 for Version 2

[OCTO-039, Introduction to Blockchain Name System Technologies](https://www.icann.org/octo-039-en.pdf) and [OCTO-040, Introduction to Blockchain Technologies](https://www.icann.org/octo-040-en.pdf) will both be updated to version 2 in approximately April 2025.
In order to meet this deadline, all changes must be accepted by mid-March, 2025.

The notes are meant to help track the expected changes to the two documents.
The originals for the two documents are in Microsoft Word; this makes commenting and tracking in the originals difficult.
Thus, this repo is used for noting changes and getting external comments on them.

All questions about this should be sent to [Paul Hoffman](paul.hoffman@icann.org).


## OCTO-039

### To Do and/or Think About

Section 4: Add an appendix that describes a public ledger that is not a blockchain that can hold name system data like ownership, delegation, DNSSEC keys, and so on.
The intended appendix is [here](public-ledger.md).

Add pointer to SAC123, SSAC Report on the Evolution of Internet Name Resolution.

## OCTO-040

### To Do and/or Think About

Briefly talk about how some blockchains reuse or expand earlier blockchains' VMs.

Add a section on blockchain standards that orginate from recognized SDOs such as ISO, ITU-x, and IEEE.

Add an appendix on chain-specific specs such as BIPs and ERCs. Maybe Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Maybe mention CASA and Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals.



### Already Done

Items in this section have already been endtered in the Word file for the upcoming v2 document.

Section 6, paragraph 3 (before the bulleted list): remove "that you can fully trust that the transactions in the blockchain, and" because it is redundant. (_done_)

Section 8, paragraph 3: replace *sidechain* with *independent chain* (three times).
Apparently the blockchain ecosystem does agree on a single definition for "sidechain", but generally agrees that an "independent chain" is one that has no relationship with any other blockchain. (_done_)
