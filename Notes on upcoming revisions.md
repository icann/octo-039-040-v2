# Informal Notes on Expected Changes in OCTO-039 and OCTO-040 for Version 2

OCTO-039 (Introduction to Blockchain Name System Technologies) and OCTO-040 (Introduction to Blockchain Technologies) will both be updated to version 2 in approximately April 2025.
In order to meet this deadline, all changes must be accepted by mid-March, 2025.

The notes are meant to help track the expected changes to the two documents.
The originals for the two documents are in Microsoft Word; this makes commenting and tracking in the originals difficult.
Thus, this repo is used for noting changes and getting external comments on them.

All questions about this should be sent to [Paul Hoffman](paul.hoffman@icann.org).

Section 6, paragraph 3 (before the bulleted list), remove "that you can fully trust that the transactions in the blockchain, and" because it is redundant.
